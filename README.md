# tweet-sentiment-analyser
Analyses the sentiment of Tweets using natural language processing.

This project was part of my coursework at Lancaster University.
The program uses MATLAB to analyse the sentiment of Tweets using a supervised learning approach.
A number of machine learning algorithms are used to determine which is most accurate.
A large dataset of Tweets with corresponding sentiment labels (text_emotion_data_filtered.csv) is used to train and test the models.
